# The drum machine!

You can see the live site [here](https://drum-machine-freecodecamp.netlify.com/) (I'm using Netlify):


This is the last project in the freeCodeCamp front end frameworks curriculum.

The site looks good only with Chrome and Firefox browsers (I didn't try to adapt it to other browsers). It also looks decent on mobie in landscape mode.

I've tried to use many things (even though not all of them are necessary) in order to learn as much as possible from it.

Of course, it was done with create-react-app, it has redux but I've also used the provider context of React for some aspects of it.

I've tried to build a folder structure that has a logic and that can be used in "real life" small scale projects.

I designed using both css and svg.
Probably the css could have been organized in a different way.
I've used css grid, flexbox, clip-path , transform, translate, text-orientation, writing-mode.

I didn't use scss, as I didn't see it's usage (tips of how it could be used in this project are welcome).
Fontawesome  library was used for the icons in the footer.

For svg I've used Inkscape.
